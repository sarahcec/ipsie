As a developer building a new B2B SaaS application, I need to:

* set up user and group provisioning and deprovisioning between a customer's workforce IdP and my application
* set up user authentication via federated relationship with a customer's workforce IdP
* ensure end users only have access to what they need in my application at any given point in time
* be able to convey to the customer's IdP that I require a certain authentication level
* know whether that authentication level was met at the IdP during a sign-in
* be notified when tokens have been revoked
* be notified when sessions have been invalidated
* receive real-time signals about changes in account posture or integrity
* receive real-time signals about changes in the endpoint posture or integrity.

To make that happen, I need to know:

* which protocols I should use
* how to securely implement and deploy those protocols at scale
* how to implement those protocols in an interoperable manner
